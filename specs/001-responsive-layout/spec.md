# Feature Specification: Responsive Layout Refresh

**Feature Branch**: `001-responsive-layout`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "重新设计整体的项目布局，让他可以更好的适配移动端和PC 端，列表页的布局需要紧凑一些，详情页的布局需要调整一下间距，让其更好阅读。不要使用过多动画，保证使用的流畅度"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

> Constitution alignment: Each user story MUST outline the automated tests (Vitest unit/integration/e2e) that will be written first, the manual accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA) to perform, and the performance metrics that demonstrate Core Web Vitals compliance.

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Mobile visitor scans article list (Priority: P1)

A first-time mobile visitor lands on the blog and needs to skim recent articles without excess scrolling or cramped text.

**Why this priority**: Mobile traffic forms the majority of new readers; presenting a compact, legible list is essential to retain them.

**Independent Test**: Open the article list on a 360px-wide viewport using production build assets; run automated snapshot/layout regression tests to verify breakpoint rules, perform manual WCAG keyboard/contrast checks, and capture Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP) metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a mobile viewport between 320px and 480px, **When** the list page loads, **Then** at least four articles appear above the fold with consistent spacing and no horizontal scroll.
2. **Given** dynamic content with mixed article title lengths, **When** the list renders, **Then** truncation and spacing preserve readability and pass automated accessibility linters.

### User Story 2 - Desktop reader compares multiple articles (Priority: P2)

A returning desktop reader wants to evaluate several articles side-by-side without feeling the layout wastes space or becomes overwhelming.

**Why this priority**: Desktop sessions drive deeper engagement and subscription conversions; optimizing density while preserving readability boosts session length.

**Independent Test**: Render the list page at 1280px width in production mode; run automated visual regression for column structure, verify keyboard navigation order, perform screen-reader spot checks, and capture Core Web Vitals to ensure desktop performance budgets hold.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a desktop viewport ≥1200px, **When** the list is displayed, **Then** the grid reorganizes to present at least two columns with balanced white space and consistent card heights.
2. **Given** hover or focus interactions on article teasers, **When** the user navigates via keyboard, **Then** states are clearly indicated without animation-induced lag or motion sickness.

### User Story 3 - Reader consumes article detail comfortably (Priority: P3)

A reader opens an article on either mobile or desktop and expects the typography and spacing to support effortless reading for several minutes.

**Why this priority**: Detail-page readability directly impacts time-on-page and content comprehension, influencing repeat visits and sharing.

**Independent Test**: Load the article detail page on 375px and 1440px viewports; run typography-focused automated tests (line length, font scaling), conduct manual WCAG checks (headings hierarchy, contrast), and gather scroll performance metrics to confirm smoothness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the detail page on any viewport ≥320px, **When** the hero and body content render, **Then** line length remains between 60 and 90 characters and paragraph spacing follows the updated rhythm without overlap.
2. **Given** a user scrolling through a 2000-word article, **When** they reach supporting media elements (images, quotes), **Then** spacing ensures the media is visually tied to the relevant text and no abrupt animation interrupts reading flow.

### Edge Cases

- Extremely long article titles or excerpts that exceed two lines in desktop or mobile contexts.
- Visitors switching orientation (portrait ↔ landscape) mid-session on tablets or foldable devices.
- Slow network conditions where images or fonts load late, potentially affecting layout shifts.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Layout MUST adapt responsively so that list and detail pages maintain legible structure across mobile (320–767px), tablet (768–1023px), and desktop (≥1024px) widths without horizontal scrolling.
- **FR-002**: List pages MUST present a compact arrangement that surfaces at least four articles above the fold on mobile and two columns on desktop while preserving accessible touch targets (≥44px).
- **FR-003**: Detail pages MUST apply revised typography (line length, line height, spacing) that keeps paragraphs and media blocks visually grouped for continuous reading.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to switch between list and detail views without perceivable layout jank; cumulative layout shift MUST remain below 0.1 on production builds.
- **FR-005**: Motion and animation usage MUST be limited to subtle feedback (≤150ms transitions) and respect user “reduce motion” preferences, ensuring 60fps interactions.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Experience MUST comply with WCAG 2.1 AA (keyboard access, ARIA labelling, contrast checks recorded in plan/spec).
- **NFR-002**: Primary journeys MUST meet Core Web Vitals budgets (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms on fast 3G) with a documented measurement process.
- **NFR-003**: Deployment MUST run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` successfully before merge.
- **NFR-004**: Any temporary manual validation MUST include a TODO for automation with owner and deadline.
- **NFR-005**: Responsive layouts MUST pass device-lab smoke tests covering at least one iOS, one Android, and one desktop browser viewport before release.
- **NFR-006**: Updated typography and spacing MUST score ≥80/100 in moderated usability testing for readability comfort.
- **NFR-007**: Perceived responsiveness MUST maintain 60fps scroll interactions on both mobile and desktop, confirmed via performance profiling.

## Assumptions

- Existing article metadata (title, excerpt, hero image) remains unchanged; the update focuses solely on presentation.
- The design system will supply updated spacing and typography tokens without introducing new content types.
- Analytics tracking already captures Core Web Vitals and will be reused to validate performance baselines post-launch.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 90% of moderated mobile testing participants report the article list is “easy” or “very easy” to scan within 30 seconds.
- **SC-002**: Desktop sessions show a 20% increase in multi-article clicks per visit within four weeks of launch.
- **SC-003**: Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) remain within target budgets for both list and detail pages during A/B rollout, with no regression beyond ±5%.
- **SC-004**: Average scroll depth on detail pages increases by at least 15% compared to the previous layout, indicating improved readability.
