## Implementation Evidence Tracking

### User Story 1 – Mobile visitor scans article list

- [ ] US1: `/blog` 360 px WCAG keyboard/contrast findings documented — TODO capture checklist after manual run (Owner: Codex, Due: 2025-11-03)
- [ ] US1: `/blog` 360 px Lighthouse (LCP, INP, CLS) metrics captured from production build — TODO run `pnpm build && pnpm exec lighthouse http://127.0.0.1:8788/blog --preset=mobile` post-implementation

### User Story 2 – Desktop reader compares multiple articles

- [ ] US2: `/blog` ≥1280 px WCAG keyboard/focus evidence documented — TODO capture keyboard traversal recording (Owner: Codex, Due: 2025-11-03)
- [ ] US2: `/blog` ≥1280 px Lighthouse (LCP, INP, CLS) metrics captured from production build — TODO run `pnpm exec lighthouse http://127.0.0.1:8788/blog --preset=desktop` after production build

### User Story 3 – Reader consumes article detail comfortably

- [ ] US3: `/blogs/:slug` WCAG heading hierarchy & contrast notes documented — TODO note findings from manual audit (Owner: Codex, Due: 2025-11-03)
- [ ] US3: `/blogs/:slug` scroll performance + Lighthouse metrics recorded — TODO profile `/blogs/sample` scroll FPS + Lighthouse (Owner: Codex, Due: 2025-11-03)

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
