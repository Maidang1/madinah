{"/blogs/farmfe-plugins-ci":"The blog introduces farm plugins CI for JavaScript and Rust plugins. For Rust plugins, it builds for multiple platforms and deploys to npm registry. For JavaScript plugins, similar steps are followed. Both use pnpm --filter '{xx}[HEAD~1]' to build only changed plugins and contains to determine if CI should run. The summary emphasizes these two points for reducing build time and controlling CI execution.","/rusts/start":"**Blog Summary**\n\nThe blog post is about getting started with the Rust programming language. The author, Madinah, provides a simple example of a \"hello, world\" program in Rust.\n\nIn this example, the `main` function is defined, which contains the `println!` macro that prints \"Hello, world!\" to the console.\n\nThis post is likely intended for beginners who want to learn how to write their first Rust program. The simplicity of the code makes it accessible to those new to programming languages.\n\nThe author's goal appears to be introducing readers to the basics of Rust and encouraging them to try out the language themselves. Overall, this post provides a concise introduction to getting started with Rust."}
