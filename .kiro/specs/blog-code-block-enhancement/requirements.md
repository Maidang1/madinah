# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the code block experience in the blog by improving visual design, adding interactive functionality, and optimizing user experience. The current implementation uses remark-shiki-twoslash for syntax highlighting but lacks modern interactive features and polished styling that users expect from contemporary technical blogs.

## Glossary

- **Code_Block_System**: The complete system responsible for rendering, styling, and providing interactive features for code blocks in blog posts
- **Syntax_Highlighter**: The remark-shiki-twoslash plugin that provides syntax highlighting functionality
- **Copy_Button**: An interactive element that allows users to copy code content to clipboard
- **Language_Badge**: A visual indicator showing the programming language of the code block
- **Line_Numbers**: Optional numbered lines displayed alongside code content
- **Theme_System**: The dual light/dark theme system used throughout the blog

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to easily copy code snippets to my clipboard, so that I can quickly use the code in my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a code block, THE Code_Block_System SHALL display a copy button in the top-right corner
2. WHEN a user clicks the copy button, THE Code_Block_System SHALL copy the code content to the clipboard
3. WHEN the copy operation succeeds, THE Code_Block_System SHALL show a visual confirmation for 2 seconds
4. WHEN the copy operation fails, THE Code_Block_System SHALL display an error message
5. THE Code_Block_System SHALL support copying multi-line code blocks with preserved formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want enhanced visual presentation of plaintext code blocks, so that non-syntax-highlighted content is still visually appealing and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code block contains plaintext content, THE Code_Block_System SHALL apply optimized typography for readability
2. THE Code_Block_System SHALL use appropriate background colors and contrast for plaintext blocks in both light and dark themes
3. THE Code_Block_System SHALL maintain consistent spacing and padding for plaintext content
4. THE Code_Block_System SHALL ensure plaintext blocks integrate seamlessly with syntax-highlighted blocks
5. THE Code_Block_System SHALL apply subtle visual enhancements to distinguish plaintext from regular paragraph text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want clear visual indicators of programming languages, so that I can quickly identify the type of code being presented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code_Block_System SHALL display a language badge for each code block
2. WHEN a code block has a specified language, THE Code_Block_System SHALL show the language name in the badge
3. THE Code_Block_System SHALL position the language badge appropriately without interfering with content
4. THE Code_Block_System SHALL use consistent styling for language badges across all themes
5. WHEN no language is specified, THE Code_Block_System SHALL handle plaintext blocks with special visual treatment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want improved visual styling of all code blocks, so that both syntax-highlighted and plaintext code is readable and aesthetically pleasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code_Block_System SHALL use rounded corners with consistent border radius for all code blocks
2. THE Code_Block_System SHALL apply subtle shadows and borders for depth perception
3. THE Code_Block_System SHALL ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility in both light and dark themes
4. THE Code_Block_System SHALL use consistent padding and margins for visual harmony
5. THE Code_Block_System SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing Theme_System

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want smooth animations and transitions, so that interactions feel polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements appear or disappear, THE Code_Block_System SHALL use smooth fade transitions
2. THE Code_Block_System SHALL animate button state changes with appropriate timing
3. THE Code_Block_System SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
4. THE Code_Block_System SHALL ensure animations do not interfere with code readability
5. THE Code_Block_System SHALL use consistent animation durations across all interactions
